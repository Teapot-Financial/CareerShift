    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals (Stone, Slate, Teal) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A tab-based SPA. A top navigation bar allows switching between the 3 career paths. The default view shows high-level summaries. Clicking a path displays its detailed, multi-phase roadmap in a clear, tabular format with a summary chart. This structure facilitates easy comparison and progressive disclosure of dense information, which is ideal for decision-making. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Phased roadmaps with skills, times, and resources. Goal: Compare paths and explore details. Viz/Method: Main navigation via styled buttons. Path details presented in semantic HTML tables for clarity and accessibility. A Chart.js bar chart summarizes the time commitment for each phase, providing a quick visual anchor. Interaction: Clicking tabs updates the main content view and the summary chart. Justification: This approach prioritizes readability and direct comparison over complex, unnecessary visualizations. Library: Chart.js for canvas-based charts. -->
